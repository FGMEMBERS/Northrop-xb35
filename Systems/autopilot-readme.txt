The autopilot file in use is from the B2 Stealth Bomber.
It works well in the XB-35 with no modifications.

The autopilot is turned on and off using the Autopilot menu. The wings level option allows for controlled banking.

The B2 has nasal code which automatically activates the autopilot at various times during flight. This code has not been moved to the XB-35.

The previous XB-35 autopilot file has been renamed autopilot-xb35.xml. It is not being used. Whichever file is named autopilot.xml will be used.
